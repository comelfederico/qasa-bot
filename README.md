## Security Notes

- Never commit your `config.yaml` to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Consider using a dedicated Gmail account for the bot
- Regularly rotate your app passwords

## Scheduling

The bot runs on a smart schedule:

- **Active Hours**: 7 AM to 11 PM (configurable)
- **During Active Hours**: Checks every 5-40 minutes (random intervals)
- **Outside Active Hours**: Sleeps until next active period
- **Benefits**: 
  - Saves resources and costs
  - More likely to find listings when people are active
  - Reduces server load during off-hours

### Customizing Active Hours

Set these environment variables to change the schedule:

```bash
# Example: Run from 8 AM to 10 PM
ACTIVE_START_HOUR=8
ACTIVE_END_HOUR=22

# Example: Run 24/7 (not recommended)
ACTIVE_START_HOUR=0
ACTIVE_END_HOUR=23
```

## Monitoring

The bot will:
- Print logs to console
- Send email notifications for new listings
- Save seen listing IDs to `seen_listings.json`
- Show current active hours and sleep status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Playwright browser issues**: Make sure you're using the Docker setup or have proper browser dependencies
2. **Gmail authentication**: Ensure you're using an app password, not your regular password
3. **Rate limiting**: The bot includes random delays to avoid being blocked

```bash
# Docker
docker logs qasa-bot
